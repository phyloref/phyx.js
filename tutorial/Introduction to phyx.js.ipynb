We recommend installing [Jupyterlab via Homebrew on Mac](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jupyterlab#default), but [other installation options are available](https://jupyter.org/install). Once Jupyter Notebook is set up, you should be able to open this notebook for editing by running `jupyter notebook Introduction\\ to\\ phyx.js.ipynb` from the command line.\n",
