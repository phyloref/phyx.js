# Tutorials

[![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/phyloref/phyx.js/tree/master/tutorials/)


This directory is intended to store multiple tutorials as executable [Jupyter Notebook]
files using [IJavascript] as a Node.js kernel. A [Makefile] is included that can be used
to build Markdown and PDF versions of these tutorials, using [Jupyter nbconvert] and
[pandoc]. We use the [eisvogel] LaTeX template as the template for our PDF.

Currently available tutorials:
- [Introduction.ipynb] - An introduction to phyx.js ([Introduction.md], [Introduction.pdf])
