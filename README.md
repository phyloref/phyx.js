# phyx.js

The Phyloreference Exchange (PHYX) format is a JSON representation that can be
used to store and transfer definitions of [phyloreferences]. This library provides
classes to help interpret some parts of these files, and for transforming an
entire Phyx file into a [JSON-LD] representation that can be reasoned over with
an [OWL 2 DL] reasoner. See the [Phyloreference Curation Tool] or the [Clade Ontology]
for examples of its usage.
